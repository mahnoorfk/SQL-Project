# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals

The main objective of the project was to improve the consistency and accuracy of the data in the Ecommerce database, making it ready for analysis. The second objective of the project was to ensure reliability of the dataset.

## Process

-Cleansing the data of missing values, duplicate values and incorrect/irrelevant values.

-Producing a quality assurance process in order to address risk areas.

## Results

The main insights from the analysis showed the average number of products ordered from visitors in each city and country, and the top-selling product from each country. 
These conclusions were made using the ordered quanity data from the products table. 

## Challenges

-Understanding what the data means. A lot of the columns were not self explanatory and most of the columns in the tables contained null values. 

-Drawing links between tables (especially with the analytics table.)

## Future Goals

-I would format columns to make sure the values are uniform.

-I would also explore the idea of primary keys in each table.
